# Omnifood Project

Welcome to my Omnifood project! This single-page website was created as the final project for my HTML/CSS course. Omnifood is a fictional company that provides AI-based meal subscriptions.

## Key Features

Building this website from scratch allowed me to learn and implement various features that will be useful in future projects.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with media queries.
- **Hamburger Menu:** A hamburger menu appears on tablet-sized screens and smaller for easy navigation.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Smooth scrolling is implemented for all navigation links in the header and footer.
- **Viewport Animations:** Subtle animations trigger based on viewport visibility using the IntersectionObserver API.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Added cross-browser support for certain CSS styles with vendor prefixes (-webkit, -moz-, -o-, -ms-).
- **Browser Testing:** Tested the website across different browsers and devices, ensuring consistent appearance and functionality.
- **Functional Contact Form:** Includes a working contact form for user inquiries.
- **Modern Layout Techniques:** Utilized CSS grid, flexbox, and absolute positioning to create a modern and flexible layout.
