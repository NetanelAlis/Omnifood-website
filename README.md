Welcome to my Omnifood project! This single-page website was created as the final project for my HTML/CSS course. Omnifood is a fictional company that provides AI-based meal subscriptions.
Key Features

Building this website from scratch allowed me to learn and implement various features that will be useful in future projects.

# Key Features
    -Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes with media queries.
    -Hamburger Menu: A hamburger menu appears on tablet-sized screens and smaller for easy navigation.
    -Smooth Scrolling: Smooth scrolling is implemented for all navigation links in the header and footer.
    -Viewport Animations: Subtle animations trigger based on viewport visibility using the IntersectionObserver API.
    -Cross-Browser Compatibility: Added cross-browser support for certain CSS styles with vendor prefixes (-webkit, -moz-, -o-, -ms-).
    -Browser Testing: Tested the website across different browsers and devices, ensuring consistent appearance and functionality.
    -Functional Contact Form: Includes a working contact form for user inquiries.
    -Modern Layout Techniques: Utilized CSS grid, flexbox, and absolute positioning to create a modern and flexible layout.
